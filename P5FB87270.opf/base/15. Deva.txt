Chapter XV The Beginner and the Good Friends

The Bodhisattvas who stand on the stage of beginners,Who with resolute intention have set out
for the supreme enlightenment of a Buddha,They, the discerning, should, as good pupils intent
on respect for their Gurus, -Always tend their spiritual teachers [who are their ‘good
friends’].

For what reason? From that [tending] come the qualities of the learned.They [the good friends]
[are those who] instruct in the perfection of wisdom.Thus preaches the Jina, the holder
of all the best qualities:‘Dependent on the good friend are the Buddha-dharmas.’

How a Bodhisattva Helps BeingsGiving, morality, also patience and vigour,The concentrations
and wisdom should be turned over into enlightenment.But one should not grab at enlightenment,
having considered [it as belonging to] the skandhas.It is thus that it should be demonstrated
to beginners.

Coursing thus, the Oceans of Qualities, the Moons of the doctrineBecome the shelter of the world,
its refuge, and its place of rest;The means of salvation [route], the intelligence,
the islands, leaders who desire its welfare;The light, the torch, teachers of the foremost
Dharma, imperturbable.

An armour difficult to wear the greatly determined put on;But they are not armed with the skandhas,
elements or sense-fields;They are free from the notion of the three vehicles, and
have not taken hold of it;They are irreversible, immovable, and steadfast in their character.

Being thus endowed with dharma, unimpeded,Freed from hesitations, perplexity and consternation,
intent on what is beneficial,Having heard the perfection of wisdom, they do not despair.They
should be known as incapable of being led astray by others, as irreversible.

Perfect Wisdom and Its Conflict with the WorldDeep is this dharma of the Leaders, hard to see,Nor
is it obtained by anyone, nor do they reach it.For that reason, when he has obtained
enlightenment, the Benevolent and Compassionate Becomes unconcerned, - ‘what body of beings
will cognize this?’

For beings delight in a place to settle in, they are eager for sense-objects,Bent on grasping,
unintelligent, and quite blinded.The Dharma should be attained as nothing to settle in
and as nothing to grasp.Its conflict with the world is manifest.
