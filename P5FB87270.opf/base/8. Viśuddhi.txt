Chapter VIII The Meaning of Purity

The purity of form should be known from the purity of the fruit.From the purity of form and
fruit is the purity of all-knowledge.The purity of all-knowledge and of the fruit, and the
purity of form:As with the sameness of the space-element, they are not broken nor cut apart.

Having transcended what belongs to the triple world, the Bodhisattvas,[Although their] defilements
[are] removed, exhibit [their] rebirth;[Although] freed from decay, illness and death,
they exhibit decease, -This is the perfection of wisdom in which course the constantly
wise.

This world is attached to the mud of name-and-form.The wheel of birth-and-death revolves, similar
to a wind-wheel.Having cognized the revolving world as like a snare for wild beasts
The wise roam about similar to the birds in space.

He who, coursing perfectly pure, does not course in form,Nor in consciousness, perception, feeling
or will;Thus coursing he shuns all attachments.Freed from attachments he courses in
the wisdom of the Sugatas.
