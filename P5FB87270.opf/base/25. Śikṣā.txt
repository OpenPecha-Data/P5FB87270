Chapter XXV How a Bodhisattva Is Trained

When he trains himself, he does not anywhere approach a training,Nor does he get at one who
trains, or at the dharmas which [constitute] training.Who trains himself, without discriminating
between both, - training and no-training, -He trains himself in this Buddha-dharma.

The Bodhisattva who thus cognizes this training,He does not ever become deficient in training,
or immoral.Having found pleasure in them, he trains himself in these Buddha-dharmas.

He trains himself, skilful in [the superior] training, but without apprehending anything,When
they train thus in wisdom, to the wise shedders of lightNot even one single thought arises
that is unwholesome:As when the sun goes through the sky, before the impact of its raysNo
darkness can maintain itself in the intermediate space.

Perfect Wisdom Comprehends All the PerfectionsFor those who have effected a training in the
perfection of wisdomAll the [other] perfections are comprehended in it.As in the false view
of individuality all the sixty-two false viewsAre included, so are these perfections [included
in the perfection of wisdom].

As when the life faculty has been stoppedAlso all the other faculties that may exist are stopped:Just
so, when the best of the wise course in wisdom,All these perfections have been said
to be therein comprehended.

Bodhisattvas and DisciplesIn all the qualities of the Disciples and likewise of the Pratyekabuddhas,The
wise Bodhisattva becomes trained:But he does not stand in them, nor does he long
for them.‘In that [also] should I be trained,’ [he thinks].In that sense he trains himself
[in them].
