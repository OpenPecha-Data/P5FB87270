Chapter XXXII Rewards of the Six Perfections

Through Giving a Bodhisattva cuts off rebirth as a Preta.He also cuts off poverty, and likewise
all the defilements.When he courses in it [i.e. giving] he gains infinite and abundant
wealth.Through [his] giving he matures beings in trouble.

Through Morality he avoids rebirth as one of the many animals,And also the eight untoward moments;
he constantly gains rebirth at an auspicious moment.Through Patience he gains a perfect
and exalted body,With golden skin, dear to the world to look at.

Through Vigour he does not incur the loss of the bright qualities.He gains the storehouse of
the infinite cognition of the Jinas.Through Trance he casts off the sense-qualities in disgust,He
acquires the “lore,” the superknowledges and concentrations.

Having, through Wisdom, comprehended the essential original nature of dharmas,He completely
transcends the triple world and the states of woe.Having turned the precious wheel of the
Mightiest of Men,He demonstrates Dharma to the world for the complete extinction of ill.

When the Bodhisattva has fulfilled these dharmas,He then still receives the purity of the field
and the purity of [the] beings [in it].He also receives the lineage of the Buddha, the
lineage of the Dharma,And likewise the lineage of the Sangha. He receives all dharmas.“

ConclusionThe supreme physician who accords medical treatment to the sickness of the world,Has
taught this exposition of wisdom which is the path to enlightenment.It is called “The Path
to enlightenment which is the ‘Accumulation of Precious Qualities,’“ And it has been taught
so that all beings might reach that Path.
