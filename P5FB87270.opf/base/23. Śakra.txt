Chapter XXIII The Superior Position of Bodhisattvas

When the sun rises, free from clouds and one blaze of rays,Having dispelled the entire blinding
and confusing darkness,It outshines all animals such as glowworms,And also all the hosts
of the stars, and the lustre of the moon.

Just so the wise Bodhisattva, who courses in wisdom, the foremost perfection:Having destroyed
the jungle of views,The Bodhisattva who courses in emptiness and the signlessVery much surpasses
the whole world, as well as the Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas.

The Simile of the King and the Crown PrinceJust as the son of a king, a giver of wealth, desiring
the welfare [of others],Becomes a person of authority among all, much sought after.

For even now he makes [many] beings happy,How much more so when he will be established as the
resourceful [ruler] of the kingdom!Just so the wise Bodhisattva, who courses in wisdom,A
donor of the deathless, dear to gods and men.Already now he is interested in the happiness
of [many] beings,How much more so when he will be established as king of the Dharma!
