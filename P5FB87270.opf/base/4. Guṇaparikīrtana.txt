Chapter IV Relative Value of Relics and Perfect Wisdom

Asked a question by the Jina, Sakra answered:“If I could have Buddhafields like the sands of
the river Ganges,All of them filled to the top with the relics of the Jinas:Nevertheless
I would still take this wisdom, the foremost of the perfections.

For what reason? It is not that I lack in respect for the relics,But they are worshipped because
they are fostered by wisdom.Just as every man who is supported by the king gets worship,Just
so the Buddha-relics, because they are supported by the perfection of wisdom.

Simile of the Wishing JewelA precious gem, in possession of all qualities, priceless,The basket
in which it may be, should be paid homage to;Even when it has been taken out, the basket
continues to emit its radiance:Such are the qualities of that gem.

Just so it is with the qualities of wisdom, the foremost perfection,Which gain worship for the
relics of the Jina even after he has gone to rest.Therefore let him who wants to win the
Jina-qualitiesTake up the perfection of wisdom.She is the liberation.”

Perfect Wisdom and the Other Five Perfections[The Lord then said:] “Wisdom controls him who
gives gifts,And also morality, patience, vigour and concentration.She takes hold of the wholesome
dharmas so that they may not be lost.She alone is also the one who reveals all dharmas.

Simile of the ShadowsThere are in Jambudvipa many thousands of kotis of trees,Of different species,
manifold and different in form;And yet there would not also be a difference between
their shadows,But when one speaks they are all equally reckoned as shadows:

Just so do these five perfections of the JinasHave their name from the perfection of wisdom:When
they are being turned over into all-knowledge,The name of enlightenment provides one
single principle for all the six of them.
