Chapter XVII The Theme

The Elder Subhuti questions the Saviour of the World:“Teach the characteristics of those who
are secluded in Peace, of the Oceans of Qualities,How they become irreversible, and of great
might.Declare, O Jina, their qualities, merely by way of outline!”

Qualities of Irreversible Bodhisattvas“They are free from the perception of multiplicity; they
speak suitably;They do not take refuge with outside Sramanas or Brahmanas.The wise have
avoided for all time the three places of woe,And they are practised in the ten wholesome
paths of action.

Free from self-interest they instruct the world in Dharma.They take delight in the Dharma.They
always speak gently.Standing, walking, lying down, sitting, they are fully conscious [of
what they are doing].They walk along looking ahead only one yoke, their thoughts not wandering
about.

They wear garments clean and unsoiled.They become pure through the threefold detachment.Majestic
men they want no gain, but always Dharma.They have passed beyond Mara’s realms.Others
cannot lead them astray.They meditate in the four trances, but they do not use those trances
as a support [for a better rebirth].

They do not want fame, their hearts are not overcome by anger.As householders they remain constantly
unattached to their entire property.They do not seek to earn their livelihood in
the wrong way,Through bewitchment-spells, or the spells which are the work of women.

Nor do they [earn a living by] tell[ing] plausible lies to men and women.Practised in the quite
detached wisdom, the best of perfections,Free from quarrels and disputes, their thoughts
firmly friendly,They want [to see] the all-knowing, their thoughts always inclined towards
the religion.

They have avoided the barbarous populations of outlying districts, of the border regions.They
are free from doubts about their own stage, always fashioned like Meru.For the sake of Dharma
they renounce their very life, intent on their practice.These should be wisely known
as the characteristics of the irreversible.
