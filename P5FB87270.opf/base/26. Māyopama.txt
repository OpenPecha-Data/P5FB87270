Chapter XXVI Rejoicing and Perfect Wisdom

If someone resolutely rejoices in the productions of thought[Of a Bodhisattva who] has set out
for the best enlightenment and is irreversible [from it];One might [measure] the Merus
in up to a trichiliocosm by comparing them [with a tip of straw],But not that merit derived
from rejoicing.

They rejoice at the heap of merit of all beings that there are,Who desire what is wholesome,
land] who want emancipation.When for the weal of beings they have reached the infinite qualities
of a Jina,They will give the Dharma to the world for the complete extinction of suffering.

The Bodhisattva who, not discriminating, comprehendsAll dharmas as empty, signless and unimpeded,Without
any dualism he seeks in wisdom for enlightenment.Devoted to the foremost perfection
of wisdom is that Yogin.

The Simile of Space and the FirmamentAn obstruction of the space-element by the firmamentCannot
be found anywhere by anyone.Just so the wise Bodhisattva, coursing in wisdom,Is just like
open space, and he courses calmly quiet.

The Simile of the People Created by MagicAs it does not occur to a man whom a magician has conjured
up [when he looks at the audience]:‘I will please those people,’ and nevertheless
he performs his work;They see him exhibiting manifold illusory works,Although he has no body,
thought, or name.

Just so it never occurs to one who courses in wisdom:‘Having known enlightenment I will set
free the world!'In his various rebirths he is associated with manifold works,Which he manifests
like magical illusions, but he does not course in false discrimination.

The Simile of the Buddha’s Magical CreationsAs a Buddha’s magical creation performs a Buddha’s
work,But, when he does so, no thought of self-conceit arises in him:Just so the wise Bodhisattva,
who courses in wisdom,Manifests all works, comparable to a fictitious magical illusion.

The Simile of the MachineAn expert and experienced mason has made a wooden apparatus;Comparable
to a man or a woman it performs here all its works.Just so the wise Bodhisattva, coursing
in wisdom,Performs all his work by his cognition, but without discrimination.
