Chapter XXVII The Bodhisattva Worthy of Homage

To the wise, who courses thus, many congregations of gods,Having bent forth their outstretched
hands, in respectful salutation, will pay homage.The Buddhas also, as many as there are
in the world-systems in the ten directions,Effect the proclamation of the garland of the
praises of his qualities.

Mara Is Powerless against Certain BodhisattvasIf as many beings as there are in the fields countless
like the sands of the GangesWould all, let us assume, become Maras;And if every single
hair on their bodies would again magically create a snare,They all could not hinder
the wise.

For four reasons does the powerful and wise BodhisattvaBecome unassailable by the four Maras,
[and] unshakable:He becomes one who dwells in the empty; and yet he is not one who abandons
beings;He acts as he speaks; he is sustained by the Sugatas.

The True Attitude to SuchnessThe Bodhisattva who resolutely believes when this perfection of
wisdom,The mother of the Tathagatas, is being taught,And who practises the progressive path
with resolution,He should be known as having well set out towards all-knowledge.

But he does not come to a standing place in the Suchness of the Dharma-element.He becomes as
one who, like a cloud, stands in the sky without anywhere to stand on,As a sorcerer who,
like a bird, rides on the wind which offers him no support,Or as one who, by the force of
his spells, miraculously produces on a tree full-blown flowers out of season.

The Bodhisattva Dwells SupremeThe wise and learned Bodhisattva who courses thusDoes not get
at one who wakes up to enlightenment, nor also at the Buddha-dharmas,Nor at one who demonstrates,
nor also at one who loves and sees the Dharma.This is the dwelling of those who desire
calm, of those who delight in the precious qualities.

As many as there are the dwellings of Disciples and Pratyekabuddilas,Associated with the peace
and happiness of calm concentration:With the exception of the Arhat-liberation of the TathagatasThis
dwelling is among all the foremost and the unsurpassed.

How and Why One Should Dwell in EmptinessA bird dwells in space, but does not fall down.A fish
dwells amidst water, but does not die.Just so the Bodhisattva who through the trances and
powers has gone beyond,Dwells in the empty, but does not reach the Blessed Rest.

One who wants to go to the summit of the qualities of all beings,To experience the best, the
exceedingly wonderful,Buddha-cognition,To give the best gift of the highest and supreme Dharma,He
should resort to this best dwelling of those who bring benefit.
