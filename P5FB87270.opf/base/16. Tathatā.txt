Chapter XVI On Suchness

The space-element in the eastern direction, and in the southern,And so in the western and northern
directions is boundless;Above and below, in the ten directions, as far as it goesThere
is no multiplicity, and no difference is attained.

Past Suchness, future Suchness,Present Suchness, the Suchness of the Arhats,The Suchness of
all dharmas, the Suchness of the Jinas, -All that is the Dharma-Suchness, and no difference
is attained.

Wisdom and Skill In MeansIf a Bodhisattva wishes to reach thisEnlightenment of the Sugatas,
free from differentiated dharmas,He should practise the perfection of wisdom, joined to skill
in means.Without wisdom there is not the attainment of the Leaders of men.

A bird with a frame one hundred and fifty miles largeWould have little strength if its wings
were lost or feeble:If it should jump down to Jambudvipa from the abodes of the Gods of the
Thirty-three,It would travel to its destruction.

Even if he would procure these five perfections of the JinasFor many niyutas of kotis of aeons,And
would all the time tend the world with an infinite abundance of vows; -If he is without
skill in means, deficient in wisdom, he falls into Discipleship.

The Desirable Attitude to Other BeingsIf he wishes to go forth into this Buddha-cognition,He
[should have] an even mind towards the whole world, the notion of father and mother [towards
all beings]He should exert himself with a thought of benevolence, and a friendly mind;Amenable
and straight, he should be soft in his speech.‚Äù
