Chapter IX All-round Purity

Thus coursing, the wise and learned Bodhisattva,Having cut off his attachments, marches on unattached
to the world.As the sun, released from the planet Rahu, blazes forth,Or, as fire,
let loose, burns up grass, log and forest.

The Bodhisattva sees that all dharmas and the Perfection of WisdomAre pure, perfectly pure,
in their essential original nature.But he does not seize on one who sees, nor on all dharmas.This
is the practice of wisdom, the foremost perfection.‚Äù
