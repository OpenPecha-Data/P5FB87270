Chapter XVIII Deep Stations

Deep are form, feeling and will,Consciousness and perception; signless in their essential original
nature, and calm.Like one who tries to reach the bottom of the ocean with a stalk,So,
when the skandhas have been considered with wisdom, one does not get to the bottom of them,

When a Bodhisattva thus understands that these dharmasIn the deep vehicle are in the ultimate
sense stainless;Wherein there is neither skandha, nor sense-field, nor element,How can there
be to him the attainment of his own merit anywhere?

The Simile of the WomanAs a man, preoccupied with matters of greed, had made a dateWith a woman,
and would, not having met her, indulge in many thoughts;As many preoccupations as he
would have [in his mind] during a day,For so many aeons does a Bodhisattva strive to reach
his goal.

Considerations of MeritIf a Bodhisattva would for many thousands of kotis of aeonsGive spotless
gifts, and would equally guard his morality.And if another one were to preach the dharma
associated with wisdom, the foremost perfection, -The merit from giving and morality would
[by comparison] be infinitesimal.

When a Bodhisattva, having meditated on the foremost wisdom,Emerged therefrom [i.e. that meditation]
preaches the stainless Dharma,And turns over also [the merit from] that to the enlightenment
linked to the weal of the world:There is nothing that is lovely in the triple
world that could become equal to him.

And just that merit is declared to be just worthless,And likewise empty, insignificant, void
and unsubstantial.Thus coursing he courses in the wisdom of the Sugatas.Coursing [thus] he
acquires immeasurable merit.

No Growth or DiminutionAs mere talk he cognizes all these dharmasWhich the Buddha has demonstrated,
practised and revealed.Though he may teach for many niyutas of kotis of aeons,Yet
the Dharma-element does not get exhausted nor does it increase.

And as to these five perfections of the Jinas.These dharmas also have been proclaimed as mere
words.The Bodhisattva who turns over, without putting his mind to it,Does not fail; but
he experiences the supreme Buddha-enlightenment.
