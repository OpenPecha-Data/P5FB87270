Chapter VII Perfect Wisdom Guides the Other Perfections

How can those niyutas of kotis of born-blind, who are without a guide,Who are not conversant
with the way, find an entrance to the city?Without wisdom these five perfections are eyeless:Those
who are without the guide are unable to experience enlightenment.

When they are taken hold of by wisdom,Then, having gained the eye, do they get that designation
[i.e. ‘perfection’].It is like a [religious] painting [of a deity or a saint] which is
complete except for the eyes.Only after the eyes are painted in does one get one’s fee.

The Attitude to Dharmas and to the SelfWhen one who develops wisdom to the end does not seize
on the least dharma,Conditioned or unconditioned, dark or bright;Then one comes to speak
in the world of the perfection of wisdom,[Which is like] space, wherein nothing real whatsoever
is established.

When he thinks, ‘I course in the wisdom of the Jinas,I will set free niyutas of beings touched
by many ills’:This Bodhisattva is one who imagines the notion of beings,And this is not
the practice of wisdom, the foremost perfection.

Faith in the Perfection of WisdomThe Bodhisattva who has observed this foremost perfection,When
in the past he served [the Buddhas], is learned and does not doubt:As soon as he has heard
it he will again recognise the Teacher,And he will swiftly understand the Peaceful Calm
of enlightenment.

Though in the past he has honoured millions of Buddhas, and served them,If without faith in
the Jina’s perfection of wisdom,Hearing of it, he will cast it away, one of small intelligence;After
he cast it away, he will go to the Avici Hell, and no one can save him.

Therefore, have faith in this Mother of all the Jinas,If you wish to experience the utmost Buddha-cognition:Let
him be like a merchant, who has travelled to the treasure island,And who,
having lost his goods would [nevertheless] again return [to it].
