Chapter XXVIII Who Trains in Perfect Wisdom Trains in Buddhahood

Of all the trainings which have been revealed by the Leader,This teaching is the best and unsurpassed.One
who, wise in all trainings, wishes to go Beyond,He should train in this perfection
of wisdom, in the Buddha-training.

Inexhaustibility of Perfect WisdomThis is the best receptacle, the storehouse of the supreme
Dharma,The treasury of happiness and ease of those people who belong to the clan of the Buddhas.The
past and future world saviours, [and those who are at present] in the ten directions,They
have come forth from this, and yet the Dharma-element does not get exhausted.

As many trees, fruits, flowers and forest trees as there are,They all have come out of the earth
and originate in it.And yet the earth does not undergo exhaustion, or growth,It does
not get tired, does not dwindle away, making no discrimination.

The Buddhaâ€™s offspring, the Disciples and Pratyekabuddhas,The gods, and the dharmas which lead
to the ease and happiness of all the world, - as many as there are,They all have issued
from wisdom, the foremost perfection,And yet wisdom does not ever get exhausted, nor does
it increase.

As many beings as there are in the low, middle and high [regions of the] world,They have all,
so has the Sugata said, been brought about by ignorance.The machinery of ill is kept going
by the full complement of the conditions,And yet the machinery of ignorance does not get
exhausted, nor does it grow.

As many roots of skilful devices as there are, or doors and methods of cognition,They all have
issued from wisdom, the foremost perfection.The machinery of cognition is kept going by
the full complement of conditions,And yet the perfection of wisdom does not increase or become
diminished.

Conditioned CoproductionBut the Bodhisattva who understands conditioned coproduction as non-productionAnd
this wisdom as non-extinction:As the rays of the sun freed from the covering
of the clouds,So he has dispelled the covering of ignorance, and become one Self-Existent.
